# Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree - Project 2

This is the repo for project #2 from the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree program


## Data Modeling with Cassandra

To simulate a real life scenario, a fake company called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. To assist the analytics team, I have created an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. 

All of the code for this project is located within `project02_nb.ipynb`.
